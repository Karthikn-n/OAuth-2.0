### ðŸ¤” What is it?

- First of all this is authorization API not a authentication.
- It provide feature the user can access the resource without any credentials.

It basically uses 4 terms to authorize the user to access the resource.

- Resource owner (Mostly us).
- Client ( like browser, application, desktop application or any other).
- Authorization Server ( Third-Party app server will authenticate the user credentials related to this app ).
- Resource Server ( This is end point owner want to connect and get response(resource) from it). [It could be local machine or remote server].
